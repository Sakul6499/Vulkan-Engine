# Vulkan Engine

This is a pet game engine and shouldn't be used except for learning purposes.  
It provides all necessary features to render something, but that's about it... nothing more.

I eventually switched from Vulkan to WGPU and made a new pet engine project: [Orbital Engine](https://github.com/SakulFlee/Orbital).  
Since the switch, this repository will be archived.
